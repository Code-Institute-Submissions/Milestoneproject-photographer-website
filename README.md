[View website in GitHub Pages]( https://github.com/debapriya9b/Milestoneproject-photographer-website)

Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is a website for a photographer based in Athlone, Ireland.Website features a gallery of the photographer’s work, a about me page to know her little personally, a photo gallery displaying the pieces of her work recognized by different  magazines and  a contact me page for the interested customers to connect with the photographer personally for photo shoot. The website is the foreground of her business , it’s the first point of contact for fans or customers.

The business goals of this website are:
* Build brand awareness.
* Provide high quality examples of the photographer’s work.
* Drive sales in the form of first contact (via the contact page) that will then lead to a sales call with the photographer.
* Excellent UX to keep potential clients on site long enough to fill out the contact form.

## UX

##### The ideal client for this business is:
* English speaking.
*Any product owner/companies for their product photo shoot
*Families/individuals to capture their special days like birthday/marriage/engagement etc
*Parents for baby photo shoot/maternity photo shoot
*Magazines for travel photos/animal photos/abstract photos
*Interior decorators  


My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access information on the site while striving for a minimalist design. This website is:
    * Easy to navigate.
    * Steps the client through easy to understand learnable information.
    * Gives the client the information they need without overloading them.
    * Guiding them to the goal of the website - to fill out the contact form.
